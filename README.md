# Protofolio

This repository contains a personal portfolio built with React + TypeScript + Vite.

Project layout

- `frontend/` — Vite + React + TypeScript frontend. Main entry is `frontend/src/main.tsx` and the app is in `frontend/src`.

Quick start (frontend)

1. Open a terminal in the project root.
2. Install dependencies and run dev server:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL shown by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

Build for production

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Notes

- The project uses Tailwind CSS and `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
- Add a backend for contact form handling if you want to replace the current `mailto:` flow.

If you'd like, I can add an overall README section documenting the roadmap items from `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` or add a workspace-level `package.json` to manage scripts centrally.
